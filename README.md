# Article on Software engineering

The article I picked is [Software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering#:~:text=Software%20engineering%20is%20the%20systematic,test%2C%20and%20evaluate%20computer%20software.)
The reason for such a choice is I only noticed this assignment two hours before it was due.
It talks about what it means to be a software engineer 
as well as common practices of software engineering.
This article walks you through the breakdown of all the tasks associated with
software engineering projects of any scale as well as linking to different methodologies of
tackling such tasks like agile.

I really enjoyed reading this article because it really goes in depth on a topic that is broad. It also inclues how it is taught in the education space as well as its use in large scale projects, which was all interesting to read.
